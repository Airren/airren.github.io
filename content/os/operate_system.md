> [Bochs](https://bochs.sourceforge.io/)is a highly portable open source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator written in C++, that runs on most popular platforms. It includes emulation of the Intel x86 CPU, common I/O devices, and a custom BIOS. Bochs can be compiled to emulate many different x86 CPUs, from early 386 to the most recent x86-64 Intel and AMD processors which may even not reached the market yet.

> The [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) includes front ends for [C](https://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html), [C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html), Objective-C, [Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/), Ada, Go, and D, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler for the [GNU operating system](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html). The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software, free in the sense that it [respects the user's freedom](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).
