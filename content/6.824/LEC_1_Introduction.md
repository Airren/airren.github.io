## Distributed System Engineering

##### What is distributed system?

- multiple cooperating computers
- storage for big web sites, MapReduce, peer-to-peer sharing, &c
- lots of critical infrastructure is distributed

##### Why do people build distributed system?

- to increase capacity via parallelism
- to tolerate faults via replication
- to place computing physically close to external entities
- to achieve security via isolation

But:

- many concurrent parts, complex interactions
- must cope with partial failure
- tricky to realize performance potential



Why take this course ?

- interesting -- hard problem, powerful solutions
- used by real system -- driven by rise of big web sites.
- active research area -- important unsolved problems
- hands-on -- you'll build real system in the labs
