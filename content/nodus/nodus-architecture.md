command: ["ovn4nfv-k8s", "start_ovn_control_plane"]

Probe: "ovn4nfv-k8s", "check_ovn_control_plane"
```

### OVN-Controller / DaemonSet

```sh
command: "ovn4nfv-k8s", "start_ovn_controller"
Probe: "ovn4nfv-k8s", "check_ovn_controller
```

OVN command

Libvirt install 

```sh
sudo apt install -y qemu libvirt-bin ebtables dnsmasq-base
sudo apt install -y libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libvirt-dev zlib1g-dev ruby-dev
```
