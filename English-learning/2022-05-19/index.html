          <p>Today，Let&rsquo;s talk something about computer</p>
<p>All the computers that are developed are not the same, they have different designs and features. Some computers have a very high capacity as well as working speed; however, some are slow. Depending on the requirements, computers are being developed.</p>
<p>Depending upon the internal structure, and applicability, the computer system is categorized as follows −</p>
<h3 id="mainframe-computer">Mainframe Computer</h3>
<p>It is high capacity and costly computer. It is largely used by big organizations where many people can use it simultaneously.</p>
<h3 id="super-computer">Super Computer</h3>
<p>This category of computer is the fastest and also very expensive. A typical supercomputer can solve up to ten trillion individual calculations per second.</p>
<h3 id="workstation-computer">Workstation Computer</h3>
<p>The computer of this category is a high-end and expensive one. It is exclusively made for complex work purposes.</p>
<h3 id="personal-computer-pc">Personal Computer (PC)</h3>
<p>It is a low-capacity computer developed for single users.</p>
<p>Personal computers can be split into Desktop computers, laptops, mini PC, and tablets.</p>
<h5 id="laptop-computer-notebook">Laptop computer (notebook)</h5>
<p>It is a handy computer that can be easily carried anywhere.</p>
<h5 id="tablet-and-smartphone">Tablet and Smartphone</h5>
<p>Modern technology has advanced further. It has helped develop computers that are pocket-friendly. Tablets and smartphones are the best examples of such computers.</p>
<p>Next, we can talk something about the Operate System. Such as window, Linux(Ubuntu or CentsOS, or fedra, or Arch linux).</p>
<p>Windows is very expensive, one of my compute is Windows 11. I bought the license from Taobao(like Shopee), it&rsquo;s much cheaper than the official store.  When I in university, that time, I didn&rsquo;t have income. I use the hacked windows, it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>And, I am not a Windows office suit user, It&rsquo;s expensive, In China, the company named JiaShan Software, the have a production similar to Office that is WPS. It has enough compatibility with Windows Office Document, Powerpoint, and Excel. It&rsquo;s an all-in-one software. You can use WPS to edit the file with the suffix .doc , .ppt, exl, and so on,</p>
<p>In Ubuntu, there is also a free Version Office software, name Libra Office(I don&rsquo;t know is it the spell correct). I rarely used the ubuntu with a desktop,  I just use a command-line user.</p>

<p><strong>Internet Addiction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What‘s your opinion about Internet Addiction?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you ever been addicted to the internet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you been scammed before?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you a victim of fake news?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What should we do to keep our personal data safe?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, Internet online games are something that you can&rsquo;t reject by yourself. Once you drop in, you can&rsquo;t stop doing that.</p>
<p>And TikTok, the feeding video platform, is another kind of Internet drug,  while using the TikTok, I don&rsquo;t know what about the next video, so I expect the next video, and wait to get funny with it.  and my brain will produce a lot of dopamine to make me feel happy.</p>
<p>About 4 years ago,  when the TikTok became popular, I have been addicted to TikTok for a while(about 3 months). I can stop myself to swap to the next video. And I also played Tencent&rsquo;s mobile games, such as mobile Legend and  PUBG Mobile. But I haven&rsquo;t lost in the game.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big risk to use an unsafe website. If you logged into an unsafe website, you might leak your private information. Others might steal your information.</p>
<p>I know the fake news and actual news. I am not a victim of fake news.</p>
<p>We should not write our information on different sites and regularly change our passwords.</p>

<p>I will revise the material to make it a bit easy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Comment</strong></em>: Today we had our 2nd class and we used computer-related material. He has difficulty distinguishing sounds in words when speaking. Ren remembers new words and reads very well. However, some words are a bit hard for him. In listening and comprehension exercises and activities, he usually does well. He follows the material easily. Ren is achieving good success with English.</p>

<p>Ren asks pertinent questions about the material under discussion. He listens attentively and usually understands what I&rsquo;m explaining to the class. Ren demonstrates his understanding of new materials by providing an answer to the teacher&rsquo;s question. Ren&rsquo;s understanding of the material is excellent.</p>

<p>He can correctly use basic verb tenses in short sentences but I would like him to start speaking in longer, more accurate sentences. He has some difficulty understanding people who speak with average speed. Ren demonstrates an excellent understanding of new material by always providing an answer to the teacher&rsquo;s question. Airren is continuing to do very well in English.</p>

<p>I am very happy today because today we have 3 hours to go out of the housing estate. And one hour to go to the supermarket to buy necessities of life. But unfortunately,  only one person is allowed to go out for one household, so that, my wife stay at home while I went out. These past two months,  lockdown in the housing estate was like putting me into jail. I think the prisoner is much happier than me, they don&rsquo;t need to cook by themselves.</p>
<p>And the prisoners are allowed out of their cells for two hours a day, but in the past two months, we have even can&rsquo;t allow going out of our apartment door.</p>
